# Installation 

This application is completely web-based, and requires no installation steps for use. 

# Usage 

To use the application, first open a terminal for the index.js file. Once you are in the terminal, enter "node index.js." This will begin the questionnaire. After answering all of the questions, you'll receive a notification in the terminal that your README file has been generated. You'll find the README file in the same folder as your index.js file.
